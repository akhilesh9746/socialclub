Dear {C_FULL_NAME},

You've joined '{C_TITLE}'.

Most adventures have a waitlist.  If you can't attend, please use the link below
to withdraw, and let the leader know, even if it's last-minute.  Withdrawing
will automatically let the first person off the waitlist, and will ensure that
you don't get marked as a no-show in the database.
