<h1>Status Objects</h1>

<p>This part of the website manages statuses.  The system marks objects in
the database with a status; most objects have the default status, which
means they exist and nothing else special, but objects may be marked as
deleted or, for special purposes, various other status codes.</p>

<p>Use the links below to manage status objects.</p>
